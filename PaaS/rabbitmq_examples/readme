Commit a docker container to save its state (for example, if you installed python, a library etc):

As an example, after launching rabbitmq from the rabbitmq image, installed python. To make it persistent, you 
want to commit it using the command:

'sudo docker commit 6545e00910fe cloudassignment/rabbitmq'

To get the container ID to issue the above command, use 'sudo docker ps' 
List images to see if the new image was created using 'sudo docker images'

To export the image to share it with others do: 
'sudo docker save 'cloudassignment/rabbitmq' > cloudassignment.rabbitmq.tar'

To import it from tar, do:
'docker load --input cloudassignment.rabbitmq.tar'
